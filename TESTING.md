# Testing

This is very much a work in progress. In the _test_ directory the script
`run-tests` builds Docker images use both _Dockerfile_ and _Dockfile-Node_. It
also uses the `docker-compose config` command to verify that the Docker Compose
are free of syntax errors.

Other suggestions on how to test and validate these configurations are welcome.
